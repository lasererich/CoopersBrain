#### Description
To help you continuously deliver the highest product quality, reliable process data are indispensable. By aggregating and analyzing overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) data, production planners, decision-makers, and even line personnel will always have an overview of the current efficiency of their respective production line. With OEE dashboard, they cannot only identify trends but will also have the necessary knowledge base for continuous improvements.

The OEE dashboard is a key part of Coperion’s digital C-BEYOND platform. The data can be displayed via a secure VPN connection on any web browser. With comprehensive export and analytics features, the OEE dashboard is the universal starting point for any kind of evaluation of your plant data.

#### Features
**Production data monitoring**
The OEE live dashboard provides continuously updated information on the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the production line, such as machine availability, capacity and product quality, and enables tracing back to all production data. The OEE calculation is highly customizable to fit the operator’s requirements, whether it is a simple task such as installing an additional feeding system, a general productivity overview or a sophisticated OEE analysis.

The data presented in the dashboards can be can conveniently exported at the push of a button and thus be integrated into a presentation or spreadsheet. Moreover, comprehensive productivity analyses can be performed by comparing historical data with current production data.

**OEE indicators**
OEE supports both operators and management to pinpoint productivity issues and track production history for events arising from changes in production. Making performance indicators of the machines available to operators increases transparency as never before. Experience indicates sharing performance indicators with your staff raises their level of commitment and consequently boosts productivity. To ensure a smooth flow of information between line personnel and management, OEE indicators provide uniform evaluation data at both the management and the operational detail level.

**Tracking downtime**
Production disruptions due to recipe changes, or maintenance tasks, are automatically recorded and can be evaluated in the OEE dashboard. For in-depth analyses, individual downtime categories can be configured. In the event of machine failures, automatic messages are generated for management and service personnel, enabling faster reactions.
