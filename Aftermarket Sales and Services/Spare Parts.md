##### Need to Know
The Coperion K-Tron project or commission number is the surest way to determine what equipment you have.

- The Coperion K-Tron Project/Commission # is on every Coperion K-Tron feeder and control panel and also on the spine of your Coperion K-Tron manual.
- Your Project/Commission # will tell your service technician if the equipment is under warranty.

If you don't have your project/commission number, your Coperion K-Tron Service Technician needs to know your specific equipment.

- The exact type of feeder (including agitation) for each feeder involved. The Coperion K-Tron control unit in use with your feeder. This is the specific Coperion K-Tron interface, not the type of PLC or host computer you are using.
