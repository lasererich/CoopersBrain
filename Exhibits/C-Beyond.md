#### Description
C-BEYOND empowers your plant to fully embrace digital transformation throughout its entire lifecycle. With real-time tracking of performance parameters across your production line, detailed Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) evaluations, and advanced AI-driven maintenance, C-BEYOND maximizes your operational efficiency while safeguarding your critical data.

#### Key Features
- **OEE dashboard:** The OEE dashboard provides instant access to comprehensive production data through an intuitive interface. It eliminates the guesswork by offering detailed OEE analysis charts and quick overviews to ensure your plant operates at peak performance. Increased uptime and maximum productivity are just a few clicks away.
- **Downtime Tracking:** Minimize unplanned downtime with C-BEYOND’s advanced downtime tracking tools. Identify the root causes of stoppages, analyze patterns, and implement corrective actions to keep your production line running smoothly.
- **Lifecycle Manager:** Optimize your maintenance strategy with AI-powered maintenance tools that increase plant availability. The C-BEYOND Maintenance Manager offers predictive maintenance insights, helping you to preemptively address potential issues before they result in costly downtimes.
- **Smart Monitoring & Alarm Management:** Stay ahead of operational issues with C-BEYOND’s Monitoring & Alarm Features. These tools provide a customizable overview of your machine or entire plant, allowing you to quickly assess production performance at a glance. The integrated alarm system ensures you and your operators remain informed of critical events, even when you’re away from the machine or not actively using C-BEYOND.
- **Sustain app:** Track your energy consumption and associated CO₂ emissions with the Sustain App. This tool provides a breakdown of energy use from the plant level down to individual equipment, helping you optimize energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
- **Secure IT infrastructure:** The C-BEYOND concept enables secure operation and easy integration of systems into your internal networks and IoT environment. Coperion recommends installing an additional machine network that is isolated from the company network and solely dedicated to communication between your machines and the gateway to the internet. A special two-tier hardware concept – with one gateway for a VPN connection to the internet and another for internal data acquisition within the machines – protects the transmission of sensitive production data to the C-BEYOND online platform against unauthorized access.
- **CSB 4.0 service box:** Unlock remote maintenance services for Coperion’s extruders, material handling, feeding systems and entire compounding lines with the gateway ServiceBox CSB 4.0. These services help ensure seamless operation of both your compounding lines and extruders as well as material conveyors and their associated components. The ServiceBox CSB 4.0 hardware is designed for quick retrofit on all existing Coperion machines as the key pillar for a secure, dedicated, two-tier IT architecture.
