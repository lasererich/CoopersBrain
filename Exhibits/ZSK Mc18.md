#### Description
The ZSK Mc18 high performance twin screw extruder is a superlative product. With its torque of 18 Nm/cm3, it has made a name for itself on the market as a throughput champion for products with high torque requirement such as engineering plastics. The 30% increase in torque compared to the predecessor extruder model ZSK Mc PLUS leads to increases in throughput of up to 100%. Therefore the ZSK Mc18 twin screw extruder ensures production with maximum economic efficiency. The optimum price/performance ratio, the extremely energy-efficient operation, the wide range of applications, and the associated high level of flexibility of the machine are additional advantages.

#### Advantages
- More than 30% increase of specific torque
- Up to 100% increase in the throughput rate
- Increased energy efficiency by reduced specific energy input
- Greatly improved productivity 
- Improved compounding quality by gentle processing with a higher filling degree
- Reduced compound temperature at much greater throughput rates Flexible, wide area of applications
- Proven high ZSK safety enabled by new designs and developments 
- Gentle product handling for maximum quality 
- Maximum flexibility in product changes and machine modifications 
- Optimum graduation of the machine sizes
- Excellent mixing behaviour
