#### Description
Four models, zero features you don’t need: The all-new ProRate PLUS is a feeder that may seem modest, but it shines when you use it for the first time (and, of course, every time after that). It’s a feeder that is simple to integrate, to fill, to operate, to clean. It is robust and reliable. It gets the job done, no matter what. The all new ProRate PLUS is a lot of things, but most of all, it’s surprisingly powerful.

#### Advantages
- **SIMPLE** to install and operate
- **ROBUST** design
- **RELIABLE** feeding, weighing and control technology
- Economical feeding solution
- State-of-the-art digital weighing technology for reliable performance
- ProClean Rail for easy cleaning
- Both vertical and horizontal outlets included
- ProFlow flow aid for moderate flowing bulk materials
- Fast delivery

#### Areas of Application
Reliable feeding of free-flowing bulk materials in plastic processing applications. The ProRate PLUS Continuous Gravimetric Feeder Line has been designed with the specific requirements of the plastics processing industry in mind. The single screw feeders are available in three sizes are designed for free to moderate flowing bulk materials and a twin screw feeder is available for moderate to free flowing powder additives. Due to its compact design, the ProRate PLUS not only works as a single unit but also integrated into a cluster of up to six feeders which can be easily grouped around the same extruder inlet.

#### Related Equipment
- **ProClean Rail:** Easy access for cleaning and maintenance is always guaranteed thanks to the patent-pending ProClean Rail system. ProClean Rail is designed to allow the base unit to be retracted the rear and then rotated for optimal access. This facilitates maintenance and cleaning of the feeding unit without having to move the feeder.
- **ProFlow Bulk Solid Activator:** The ProFlow bulk solid activator is a completely new and cost-effective solution to feed powders.
- **ProRate PLUS Load Cells:** P-SFT Smart Force Transducer load cells, operating under compression, provide accurate, stable and reliable digital weight measurement under a broad range of operating conditions.
- **ProRate PLUS PCM Control Modules:** With the ProRate PLUS control system each feeder has its own PCM control module, installed directly at the feeder. In a line setting, up to eight feeders can be controlled from one PCM-KD. Connection between feeders and operator interface is via an industrial network. All setup, diagnostics and operator interface functions are controlled via a the PCM-KD interface. With its tight integration into the feeder, the PCM can be pre-wired and pre-tested in the manufacturing plant.
