#### Description
Hydrocyclones are being offered for similar separation tasks like the swimsink tanks in special cases where cyclones achieve a better separating efficiency than swim-sink tanks. This unit works with a pressure force of a feeding pump and reaches a higher separation effect (approx. 20 times earthâ€™s gravity) by using the rotational forces of the moving water. The PE/PP material is leaving the Hydrocyclone at the upper end with the main-stream of the water, sinking material, PET, at the lower end with only small amounts of water. By choosing the nozzle sizes at the outlets of the cyclone the selectivity can be adjusted. Necessary equipment of a hydrocyclone circuit is a mixing tank (turbo washer), a feed-ing hydro.
