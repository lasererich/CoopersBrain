#### Description
With its specific torque of 11.3 Nm/cm3 STS Mc11 compounders sets standards: it features up to 27% higher throughput rates than the preceding model, while the higher degree of screw fill results in a decrease of melt temperature, thus improving compound quality. It incorporates the full process and quality know-how of Coperion.

The STS Mc11 series is exclusively equipped with European, Coperion branded gearboxes. Maximum screw speed has been increased from 800 to 900 min-1. To improve cleaning and facilitate quick changeovers for masterbatch applications, the STS twin screw extruder also features optimized hoppers with inserts and a redesigned die head. The screw shaft coupling is similar to the one long proven in the ZSK Mc18 series. The optimized base frame withstands torsion under maximum stress.

The STS Mc11 compounder covers most standard applications in process technology. It offers high productivity at an attractive price-performance ratio. Production of the STS Mc11 is in Nanjing, China, in compliance with CE directives. The result: A high-performance compounding system with low investment costs which ensures a fast return on investment. The modular design of the process section allows maximum flexibility in production at process lengths of 24 to 68 D
