#### Description
For recycling of post-consumer recyclate (PCR) or any highly contaminated polymer, Coperion offers the innovative ZSK FilCo filtration compounder that allows filtration and compounding in a single production step.

With the ZSK FilCo system, waste plastic is fed into a ZSK twin screw extruder, where it is melted, homogenized and devolatilized. The melt is then fed through a filter to remove all contaminants before it is fed back into the same ZSK extruder to be compounded with reinforcing materials or fillers.  

Compared to the two-step production lines that have been the norm until now, Coperionâ€™s ZSK FilCo is distinguished by a markedly more streamlined equipment set-up. Energy consumption and emissions for the extrusion process are reduced by more than 50%. Moreover, the ZSK FilCo is able to achieve a significantly higher product quality. Recompounds can be produced much faster and Coperion K-Tron gravimetric feeders ensure the high-accuracy incorporation of additives for an optimal result.

#### Advantages
- Filtration and compounding in a single production step
- One single melting step ensures gentle processing of the recyclate
- Reduced footprint thanks to streamlined configuration
