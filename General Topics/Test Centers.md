#### Description
Coperion provides test centers for various applications, such as feeding and extrusion, product handling and conveying, as well as many further processes. Tests with throughput rates of a few kg/h up to a medium production scale can be carried out and optimized in our test centers. Using proven scale-up methods, our experts transfer the test results to production scale.

Coperion’s test centers are the ideal platform for advanced testing of any challenge in a production plant, such as product behavior, new formulations and throughput rates. Depending on the process task, the latest Coperion developments are integrated into the test setup.

Tests in our test centers support the determination of the ideal equipment configuration for an application as well as the development of first-class designs for processing systems under realistic production conditions, while also further enhancing our existing technology through internal testing.

Some of our test centers also feature laboratories, where our engineers have access to numerous analysis options to evaluate product quality and characteristics.

#### Recycling Innovation Center
In this high-tech test center for plastics recycling applications, every recycling process step – from material handling and feeding to extrusion, compounding, pelletizing, material postprocessing and deodorization – can be tested.

Extensively equipped recycling systems are available that can be modified in myriad ways, depending upon the specific requirements of the recyclate to be produced.

#### Test Labs for Feeding & Conveying
We conduct tests with process materials to answer critical process questions and determine the best configuration of the feeding or conveying equipment.

We have developed a vast body of expertise and a wide range of feeding and conveying technology options to address the multitude of challenges that can arise for process operations.

#### Food Test Centers
We focus on the specific requirements of your food applications. We provide test labs for feeding and extrusion applications, food components and conveying systems.

These test labs are the ideal platform for advanced testing of any challenge in a production plant, such as product behavior, new formulations, throughput rates or food safety standards.
