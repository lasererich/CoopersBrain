#### History of Coperion
​Coperion GmbH, headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, has a rich history rooted in the late 19th century. In 1879, Hermann Werner and Paul Pfleiderer established the company Werner & Pfleiderer in Cannstatt, near Stuttgart, focusing on the production of kneading and mixing machines. This enterprise laid the foundation for what would become Coperion. ​

Throughout the 20th century, Werner & Pfleiderer expanded its expertise in machinery manufacturing, particularly in mixing and extrusion technologies. A significant milestone was achieved in 1957 when the company introduced the first co-rotating, closely intermeshing ZSK twin screw extruder, marking a pivotal advancement in extrusion technology. ​
Coperion

In 2000, the Swiss industrial firm Georg Fischer consolidated its plant engineering division, incorporating its subsidiaries Waeschle and Buss, along with the recently acquired Werner & Pfleiderer, to form Coperion Holding GmbH. This strategic move created a comprehensive provider of systems and components for plastics processing. ​

Ownership changes occurred in subsequent years, with Georg Fischer divesting Coperion to British private equity firm Lyceum Capital between 2006 and 2007. In 2008, Coperion expanded by acquiring Hartmann Fördertechnik GmbH. By October 2012, the American industrial conglomerate Hillenbrand, Inc. acquired Coperion, integrating it into its portfolio. ​

A notable development took place in 2013 when Coperion merged with K-Tron, a specialist in feeding and pneumatic conveying equipment. This merger led to the creation of the Coperion K-Tron brand, enhancing the company's capabilities in process equipment solutions. ​
Coperion

Today, Coperion stands as a global industrial and technological leader, offering compounding and extrusion systems, material handling equipment, and comprehensive services to industries such as plastics, chemicals, food, pharmaceuticals, and minerals.
