#### Description
Coperion has vast experience and has handled many projects, from R&D lab scale up to complete production lines, for all major battery components, i.e. compounding of cathode and anode materials, separators for lead-acid batteries and lately an increasing number of separators for Li-ion batteries.

The separator is a key component of every Li-ion battery, which is located between the anode and cathode and separates those two electrodes from each other to prevent internal short circuits, which at worst can lead to a fire or even an explosion. Hence, the separator plays an important role, when it comes to battery safety and reliability. Most battery separators are currently made out of polyolefins, where Coperion’s twin screw extruder systems have gained years of experience. Due to comprehensive engineering know-how, customized screw design and high process reliability Coperion systems ensure excellent quality of the final product.
