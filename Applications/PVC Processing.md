#### Description
The production of high-quality end products is the key to success when meeting the high demands of the PVC market. Coperion and Coperion K-Tron are specialists in the design, construction and implementation of complete plants and systems for processing of PVC – from the raw material handling and feeding, to dryblend production in the heat-cool mixer, to the cooling and packaging of the pellets.

#### Areas of Application
**Soft-PVC**

- PVC cables: insulation material, sheathing and bedding compounds
- Material for shoes and shoe soles (also PVC-P with foaming agent)
- Material for the extrusion of profiles and hoses (including medical applications)
- Injection molding compounds
- Films and sheets for flooring

**Rigid-PVC**

- Material for the extrusion of profiles for interior and exterior uses
- Injection molding grades for fittings, etc.
- Blow molding grades for bottles, containers, etc.
- Alloys and blends
- Films (calander feeding)

#### Product Range
- **Compounding Machines and Extruders:** The two-stage Kombiplast processing system consisting of a ZSK twin screw extruder and an ES-A single shaft discharge screw forms the heart of PVC compounding plants. The Kombiplast achieves highest product quality at maximum throughputs. This is due, among other things, to its excellent mixing properties, its high process flexibility and the optimal compression and venting properties.

- **Feeding Equipment:** When feeding PVC, choosing the right feeder is essential to the operation's success. The properties of the raw materials, the size of the compounding operation and an end-product formula determine whether the material is fed gravimetrically or volumetrically. The type of feeder used (single, twin screw or rotary valve) and the order in which the materials are added are choices our specialists can help you with to improve your operation's efficiency.
