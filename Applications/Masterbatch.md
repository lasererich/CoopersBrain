#### Description
The processing of masterbatch makes great demands on the compounding process: The pigment and additive parts must be mixed into the base polymer absolutely homogeneously. Coperion compounding systems and extruders are particularly suitable for the processing of masterbatch because of their excellent mixing properties and gentle product handling. In addition, Coperion and Coperion K-Tron offer a wide range of material handling components such as feeders, valves and conveying systems for both the raw ingredients and the end product.  
  
With our extensive process know-how we tailor all the process steps from raw materials feeding, conveying, melting, dispersing, homogenizing, devolatilizing, pressure build-up to filtering and pelletizing exactly to the requirements of your masterbatch recipes. This gives you exactly what you expect: a compounding system that is optimally tailored to your application.

The term masterbatch includes concentrates of pigments or additives in a polymer matrix. Masterbatch is mainly available in the form of standard pellets but also in the form of mini-pellets. A distinction is made between white, black and colored masterbatch depending on the pigment type. The premix, split-feed and color-matching processes are available for compounding masterbatch.

#### Areas of Application
- Color masterbatch
- Special effect pigment masterbatch
- Carbon black masterbatch
- PET masterbatch

#### Product Range
- **Compounding Machines and Extruders:** Both the twin screw extruder series ZSK Mc18 and the ZSK Mv PLUS as well as the STS Mc11 are used for compounding of masterbatches. We design – depending on the masterbatch recipe – all processing steps exactly to your requirements. Special developed features such as the feed hopper with quick-release clamps, the masterbatch die head or the easy-to-clean side feeder ZS-B ensure fast, easy cleaning of the extruders and therefore economical recipe and color changes.
  
  **Twin screw extruder ZSK Mc18 for processes with high torque requirement**
  **Twin screw extruder ZSK Mv PLUS for processes with high volume requirement**
  **Twin screw extruder STS Mc11 with best price-performance ratio for most standard applications**
  **Auxiliary equipment for fast color changes**

- **Feeding Equipment:** Delivering the right materials in the correct amount is critical to the manufacturing of Masterbatch. Coperion K-Tron’s feeding equipment along with our engineering expertise can design a complete material handling solution. Our screw feeders feed the most critical ingredients such as pigments at a high level of accuracy, even at low rates, while the Bulk Solids Pump (BSP) feeders are ideal for consistent feeding of the main polymer.  In addition, the KQx and QC feeders incorporate a quick clean design for easy material changes.
  
  **Single Screw Feeders**
  **Twin Screw Feeders**
  **BSP Feeders**

- **Material Handling:** Coperion and Coperion K-Tron have the right material handling solution for your Masterbatch process.  Vacuum sequencing systems for bulk material handling and automated feeder refill can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the process. Maximum system performance is achieved by taking into consideration factors such as plant layout, material delivery, material characteristics, batch size and the required conveying rates.
  
  **Vacuum Loaders**
  **Vacuum Sequencing Receivers**
  **Discharge Valves**

- **Plants and Systems:** Coperion has comprehensive know-how and longtime expertise in the design of compounding plants for masterbatch production. From raw materials handling and feeding to the twin screw extruder and down to the pelletizer, we skillfully adapt all system components to each other.
