#### Description
**Coperion and Herbold Meckesheim**
Our technologies play a key role in the global manufacture of high-quality plastic recyclates. We unite decades of expertise and comprehensive process know-how in a variety of plastics recycling applications.

#### Coperion and Herbold
**Perfect Match**
The competencies of Coperion and Herbold Meckesheim complement each other perfectly. Coperion is the technology leader for extrusion and compounding, bulk material systems and feeding. Herbold Meckesheim is specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics and plastic waste.

#### Applications
**Plastic Recycling Technology For Various Applications**
Coperion and Herbold Meckesheim design complete recycling systems for a wide range of applications, from mechanical recycling to chemical recycling, from multi-layer film recycling, bottle-to-bottle recycling to upcycling and odor reduction.

We ensure the smooth interaction of all process steps which include shredding, washing, separating, drying and agglomerating plastics, material handling, feeding, twin screw extrusion, pellet treatment (cooling, drying, homogenization) and finished product handling. Our plants provide maximum productivity and efficiency.

#### Solutions
- **Chemical Plastic Recycling:** Chemical recycling is a promising process to recycle mixed plastic waste into chemicals, waxes or liquid energy carriers.
- **Multi-Layer Film Recycling:** Coperion offers a closed-loop solution in which up to 100% of multi-layer film production waste can be re-processed into the production process.
- **PET-Recycling:** PET plays an ever more important role in recycling. Using Coperion’s innovative technology PET flakes can be processed into bottles, films or fibers again.
- **Bottle-to-Fiber Recycling:** Thanks to excellent degassing properties, ZSK twin screw extruders are ideal for producing fibers from PET flakes.
- **Plastic Upcycling:** With Coperion's upcycling solutions recyclates are optimized in their properties to such an extent that they achieve a quality equivalent to that of primary material.
- **Odor Reduction:** Removing unpleasant odors is a prerequisite if plastic recyclates from post-consumer waste are to be used for the manufacture of new products.
