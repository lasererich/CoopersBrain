# Bioplastics

#### Tags

#Hall14 #Plastics #Applications

#### Description

Bioplastics are biodegradable, bio-based, or both. They represent a
market-ready solution and are already in use in a variety of
applications. 

Bioplastics manufacturing places very high demands upon the compounding
process due to the number of possible base polymers and the vast
differences in recipe mixtures. Every process step in the compounding
systems must be precisely aligned with the mechanical properties
required in  the end product.

Coperion and Coperion K-Tron have decades of experience in realizing
systems for bioplastics manufacturing. We possess unique process
expertise and comprehensive system know-how for the entire process chain
-- from raw material conveying to premixing, feeding, extrusion,
pelletizing and drying, as well as the gentle conveying of biocompounds.
As a result, you profit from our in-depth knowledge, acquired in the
fields of plastics compounding and cooking extrusion.

#### Areas of Applications

- Starch-based bioplastics
- Thermoplastic starch (TPS)
- Compounds made of various biopolymers such as PLA, PVOH, PBS, PBAT,
  PHA, PCL, CA
- Biopolymer filling with up to 80% filler (e.g. CaCO3, talc)
- Masterbatch for bioplastics

#### Process

**Filling and Mixing of Biopolymers** When filling and mixing
biopolymers, we achieve throughputs with our systems that are comparable
to those of fossil-based engineering plastics. A wide range of feeding
technologies allows us to provide an optimized feeding system for any
bulk material. Using patented FET technology, the extruder's intake
section is equipped with a porous, gas-permeable wall to which a vacuum
is externally applied. The resulting gas vacuum markedly increases the
material intake capacity and throughput when processing feed-limited
products. Due to the intensive mixing and devolatilization in the
extruder, very high product quality is achieved.

**Thermoplastic Starch Manufacturing Using Cooking Extrusion (TPS)**
Since native starch cannot be melted using heat, it must be converted
into thermoplastic starch (TPS). In this process, the starch powder
(i.e. from corn, potatoes, or tapioca) is gelatinized (cooked) in the
extruder. While adding liquid, heat and shearing energy, the starch's
partially crystalline structure is transformed into a completely
amorphous structure. This process is irreversible. To give the TPS more
flexibility, plasticizers, such as glycerin, can be added to the
process. Gravimetric liquid feeders ensure that additives are added with
very high accuracy, even at low feed rates.

**Starch Blend Compounding** Starch blends are mixtures of thermoplastic
starch (TPS) and plastics made from fossil-based or sustainable raw
materials. Manufacturing of this type of bioplastic, currently
comprising the largest share of all bioplastics, can be accomplished
within the twin screw extruder in a single process step. The biopolymer
is fed directly into the extruder along with components for TPS. The
recipes and properties of starch blends vary greatly depending upon the
purpose of the end product. Using high-accuracy feeders, raw materials
are introduced into the twin screw extruder. With the smart flow aid
device ActiFlow, gravimetric twin screw feeders can reliably feed even
difficultflowing starches with high accuracy. Within the ZSK extruder
the raw materials are modified by means of intensive energy introduction
and homogeneously mixed. The melt is reliably devolatilized and,
depending upon product properties, can be processed into compounds using
strand or underwater pelletizing.

#### Product Range

- **Compounding:** Our ZSK and STS series of twin screw extruders form
  the core of processing systems for bioplastics. The process
  section's modular design allows us to custom-tailor the design of the
  extruder to each process individually. Processing in
  the Coperion extruder features intensive dispersion and
  mixing performance at very low shear stress and low  temperatures. The
  product is handled very gently in the process section with a short
  residence time, while at the same time  achieving reliably high
  throughputs and highest product quality. To obtain specific product
  properties, fibers, fillers, and  additives can be introduced
  downstream into the process using side feeders. Our Feed Enhancement
  Technology (FET) ensures  a very high intake capacity for feed-limited
  products with vacuum applied to the feed zone from the outside.
  Volatile  materials are reliably removed by degassing,
  devolatilization domes and the ZS-EG side devolatilization, thus
  achieving consistently high product quality.

  **Twin screw extruder ZSK Mc18** for high torque requirement **Twin
  screw extruder ZSK Mv PLUS** for high screw volume requirement **Twin
  screw extruder STS Mc11**

- **Feeding:** For free-flowing bulk materials, our single screw feeders
  and bulk solids pumps are ideal solutions. For ingredients with poor
  flow properties, we recommend our twin screw feeders, which can be
  equipped with flow aids such as ActiFlow™ technology when needed.
  Vibratory feeders and weigh belt feeders are well suited for flakes or
  fibers. For feeding liquids, we build pump systems with hanging or
  platform scales that can be individually designed for any viscosity.
  All of our loss in-weight feeders are equipped with Smart Force
  Transducer (SFT) weighing technology to ensure high-accuracy bulk
  material feeding, batching and metering. If space is limited, up to
  six feeders can be grouped around the process inlet using the K4G
  feeder line.

  **Feeders**

- **Material Handling Equipment:** We offer solutions for handling the
  full spectrum of bulk materials in the bioplastic manufacturing
  process, encompassing both individual components as well as complete
  conveying systems. Solutions include, for example, rotary valves for
  material discharge from silos, bulk bins, or small bag dump
  stations, as well as continuous feeding into the process. Using 
  continuous vacuum and pressure conveying systems
  specifically tailored to the material, ingredients are gently
  transported to the feeders and twin screw extruders. After extrusion,
  we take over further process steps using additional technologies, 
  such as cooling/warming, devolatilization, cleaning/sifting or
  homogenization as well as conveying of the finished product.

  **Rotary Valves** **Vacuum Receivers and Loaders** **Hoppers & Bin**

- **Service:** Coperion and Coperion K-Tron offer versatile services.
  Their emphasis is never on what is possible but on what is practical.

# Masterbatch

#### Tags

#Hall14 #Plastics #Applications

#### Description

The processing of masterbatch makes great demands on the compounding
process: The pigment and additive parts must be mixed into the base
polymer absolutely homogeneously. Coperion compounding systems and
extruders are particularly suitable for the processing of masterbatch
because of their excellent mixing properties and gentle product
handling. In addition, Coperion and Coperion K-Tron offer a wide range
of material handling components such as feeders, valves and conveying
systems for both the raw ingredients and the end product.

With our extensive process know-how we tailor all the process steps from
raw materials feeding, conveying, melting, dispersing, homogenizing,
devolatilizing, pressure build-up to filtering and pelletizing exactly
to the requirements of your masterbatch recipes. This gives you exactly
what you expect: a compounding system that is optimally tailored to your
application.

The term masterbatch includes concentrates of pigments or additives in a
polymer matrix. Masterbatch is mainly available in the form of standard
pellets but also in the form of mini-pellets. A distinction is made
between white, black and colored masterbatch depending on the pigment
type. The premix, split-feed and color-matching processes are available
for compounding masterbatch.

#### Areas of Application

- Color masterbatch
- Special effect pigment masterbatch
- Carbon black masterbatch
- PET masterbatch

#### Product Range

- **Compounding Machines and Extruders:** Both the twin screw extruder
  series ZSK Mc18 and the ZSK Mv PLUS as well as the STS Mc11 are used
  for compounding of masterbatches. We design -- depending on the
  masterbatch recipe -- all processing steps exactly to your
  requirements. Special developed features such as the feed hopper with
  quick-release clamps, the masterbatch die head or the easy-to-clean
  side feeder ZS-B ensure fast, easy cleaning of the extruders and
  therefore economical recipe and color changes.

  **Twin screw extruder ZSK Mc18 for processes with high torque
  requirement** **Twin screw extruder ZSK Mv PLUS for processes with
  high volume requirement** **Twin screw extruder STS Mc11 with best
  price-performance ratio for most standard applications** **Auxiliary
  equipment for fast color changes**

- **Feeding Equipment:** Delivering the right materials in the correct
  amount is critical to the manufacturing of Masterbatch. Coperion
  K-Tron's feeding equipment along with our engineering expertise can
  design a complete material handling solution. Our screw feeders feed
  the most critical ingredients such as pigments at a high level of
  accuracy, even at low rates, while the Bulk Solids Pump (BSP) feeders
  are ideal for consistent feeding of the main polymer. In addition, the
  KQx and QC feeders incorporate a quick clean design for easy material
  changes.

# Hydroclone Unit HER

#### Tags

#Pavilion #ProcessEquipment #Exhibits

#### Description

Hydrocyclones are being offered for similar separation tasks like the
swimsink tanks in special cases where cyclones achieve a better
separating efficiency than swim-sink tanks. This unit works with a
pressure force of a feeding pump and reaches a higher separation effect
(approx. 20 times earth's gravity) by using the rotational forces of the
moving water. The PE/PP material is leaving the Hydrocyclone at the
upper end with the main-stream of the water, sinking material, PET, at
the lower end with only small amounts of water. By choosing the nozzle
sizes at the outlets of the cyclone the selectivity can be adjusted.
Necessary equipment of a hydrocyclone circuit is a mixing tank (turbo
washer), a feed-ing hydro.

# SMS 80/200

#### Tags

#Hall9 #ProcessEquipment #Exhibits

#### Description

The SMS models are machines for particularly demanding applications: the
size reduction of heavy lumps, tough fibres, extremely thin films or
simply very large amounts of material.

Granulators of the SMS series are also available as washing granulators.
In this case contaminated plastics are granulated with the addition of
large quantities of water. The resulting friction produces a good
washing effect. Washing and shredding are combined into one operation.

Here we produce machines with a working width from 500 to 2000
millimetres and drive motors from 22 to 250 kilowatts.

The SMS is the preferred machine for recycling businesses, since with an
equally high performance they can easily be converted from the
granulation of high-volume hollow materials to the granulation of
thick-walled panels or lumps.

If required, machines of the SMS series can be supplied with steel
plating. The options range from basic replaceable wear plates in the top
of the granulator and (depending on wear and tear) replaceable stator
knife supports all the way to screwed, replaceable rotor knife support
plates -- and this is all done with wear-proof materials of appropriate
hardness and toughness.

#### Advantages

- Heavy duty welded/machined steel construction
- Split housing design above the rotor for maximum access
- Outboard mounted pillow block bearings
- Rotor and bed knives are adjusted from outside of the granulator
- Constant cutting circle due to adjustable knives
- Compact and space-saving design

#### Key Features

- Heavy-duty knife granulator for tough applications and maximum outputs
- Flexible design for multiple applications by means of a removable
  deflection wedge
- Energy-efficient double cross cutting action
- Constant cutting circle due to adjustable rotor and bed knives
- Optimum access to the cutting chamber for ease of cleaning and
  maintenance

#### Related Equipment

Herbold granulators can be incorporated into any automated production
line or process as we have a large number of options available as well
as a design team to meet your needs. Options include but not limited to
the following:

- Electronic metal separation and magnetic units for extraction of
  foreign metallic objects
- Air extractors and screening machines for separation of dust particles
  and specific light parts on the granulate
- Amperage overload cut-out for regulating the load and amount of feed
  articles during the loading of the machine
- Pneumatic and mechanical loading units for feeding the machine or for
  removal of the finished granulate
- Pre-crushing unit for reduction of heavy-duty materials and to
  regulate a continuous flow of material
- Pulverizers for fine particle size

  holding force during operation. All ProRate PLUS models are outfitted
  with the ProClean Rail as a standard feature.
- **Proflow Bulk Solid Activator:** The ProFlow bulk solid activator is
  a completely new and cost-effective solution to feed powders.The
  ProFlow bulk solid activator consists of a compact electromagnetic
  vibrating device, which is mounted at the feeder trough and activates
  the polyurethane transition hopper as well as the feed hopper to keep
  bulk materials moving. The device operates at an optimized frequency
  and amplitude to ensure minimal energy consumption and maximum product
  flow. The device is self-calibrating, automatically tuning to the
  correct resonant frequency of the feeder, which results in extremely
  low energy consumption. Thanks to its smart electronic control ProFlow
  only uses 3.6 Watts. Tests with a wide range of bulk materials have
  shown that ProFlow is an ideal solution for a variety of bulk
  materials. For the smaller PLUS-S model the ProFlow activator is
  implemented in conjunction with specially developed overflight screws.
  The overflight acts as a screw filler even at low speed and helps to
  ensure that the bulk material is always in motion in the area of the
  screw intake, resulting in optimal screw fill.
- **ProRate PLUS Load Cells:** P-SFT Smart Force Transducer load cells,
  operating under compression, provide accurate, stable and reliable
  digital weight measurement under a broad range of operating
  conditions. The P-SFT exploits the dependency of a vibrating wire's
  resonant frequency on its tension to measure applied loads. Through
  mechanical means the applied load is transmitted to the wire, causing
  a change in its resonant frequency from which the weight of the
  applied load is computed by the onboard microprocessor. A fully
  calibrated (linearized, spanned and temperature compensated) signal is
  transmitted via RS 485 serial communication to the controller.
- **ProRate PLUS PCM Control Modules:** With the ProRate PLUS control
  system each feeder has its own PCM control module, installed directly
  at the feeder. In a line setting, up to eight feeders can be
  controlled from one PCM-KD. Connection between feeders and operator
  interface is via an industrial network. All setup, diagnostics and
  operator interface functions are controlled via a the PCM-KD
  interface. With its tight integration into the feeder, the PCM can be
  pre-wired and pre-tested in the manufacturing plant.

# Chemical Recycling

#### Tags

#Hall14 #Pavilion #Hall9 #PlasticsRecycling

#### Description

Plastic waste, especially packaging waste, is generally a mixture of
materials with a high degree of contamination. Recycling this raw
material is usually difficult, as sorting and cleaning of waste is in
many cases neither economically viable nor technically feasible.
Chemical recycling is a promising process to recycle these material
streams into chemicals, waxes or liquid energy carriers.  

Coperion provides first-class technologies for the chemical recycling of
post-consumer waste. Coperion K-Tron feeders ensure high-accuracy
feeding of raw materials into the extruder. Coperion's ZSK twin screw
extruders possess numerous advantages that are especially beneficial for
an energy efficient chemical recycling process.

#### Process

Chemical recycling is a promising process for recycling mixed plastic
waste, both technically and economically.

After post-consumer waste, either shredded or compacted, is reliably
added to the extruder's process section by a high-accuracy Coperion
K-Tron feeder, a great deal of mechanical energy is introduced into the
material in shortest time thanks to the continuous surface renewal as
well as intensive dispersion and shearing along the twin screws.

Within about 30 seconds, a homogeneous, highly devolatilized melt with a
temperature of up to 350°C is produced, into which the energy has been
introduced very efficiently.

Further materials, such as catalysts, can be added and mixed in as
needed. In some cases, residual water or chlorides from PVC are
introduced into the extruder in minute quantities along with the plastic
waste. Both are reliably extracted via vacuum devolatilization on the
extruder's process section.

Within the reactor, the melt, which was previously heated to up to 350°C
in the twin screw extruder, is further heated. At up to 500°C pyrolysis
of the polymers takes place, the splitting of polymer chains into
shorter units in an oxygen-free environment. The pyrolysis of polymers
utilizes the random scission mechanism, where free radicals are
generated. At the same time, chain reactions are initiated which lead to
cracking polymers into a broad mixture of hydrocarbons in liquid and
gaseous phase. The most important factors for driving this process are
residence time, temperature, and the type of pyrolysis agent.

Most of the inorganic components of the post-consumer waste remain in
the reactor's sump and are removed. The polymers' organic hydrocarbons
evaporate. They are transformed into monomers, petrochemical raw
materials, or synthesis gases and then processed further in a
destillator into marketable products such as oil, heavy fuel, or waxes.

#### Product Range

- **ZSK Twin Screw Extruders:** Coperion's twin screw extruder
  technology is particularly well suited for an efficient energy
  addition and therefore for chemical recycling of plastics. Twin screw
  extruders possess numerous advantages that are especially beneficial
  in chemical recycling. The technology covers a broad range of
  throughputs. On larger ZSK extrusion machines, throughputs of up to 20
  t/h can be realized. Polymers of various viscosities are reliably
  plastified thanks to the highly effective mode of operation of the
  twin screws. Plastic energy dissipation takes place in no time. When
  needed, corrosion and wear protection of all product-contact parts
  within the process section can assure long extruder lifetime even when
  processing very aggressive materials.

  **ZSK Mc¹⁸ Twin Screw Extruders**

- **ZS-B MEGAfeed Side Feeder:** Support your sustainability initiatives
  by minimizing energy consumption and reducing your carbon footprint.
  Our solution helps you achieve your concrete energy efficiency targets

#### Process

**Mechanical Pretreatment I Silo Degassing** In a first step, odors are
eliminated as the waste plastic undergoes mechanical pretreatment during
shredding, washing and drying. Further odors can be removed from the
shredded plastic in a silo using fresh air circulation.

**Devolatilization in the ZSK Recycling Extruder** The next, intensive
devolatilization step, which markedly improves the recompound's sensory
quality, takes place during compounding in a ZSK twin screw extruder.

Following melting and intensive homogenization of the waste plastic in
the ZSK extruder's process section, volatile particles are degassed from
the plastic melt in a highly energy efficient process. Using various
technologies such vacuum devolatilizations, these dissolved gases are
reliably removed from the product. This effect can be significantly
intensified with the addition of liquid stripping agents.

Use of a ZS-EG side devolatilization unit provides a particularly
effective and stable degassing process in the ZSK twin screw extruder,
maximizing its deodorizing capabilities when high quantities of gas are
present.

**Degassing recycled plastic compounds** Coperion also offers post
extrusion and pelletizing deodorization systems that play a further key
role in improving waste plastic to the qualitative level of new plastic.
They reliably remove any residual unpleasant odors from recycled plastic
compounds. Hot air flows through the pellets in silos, diffusing even
particularly stubborn, long-chain molecules from the compounds. For this
step, Coperion has developed two different process solutions, depending
upon the desired end product quality, the temperature it requires,
residence time and quantity of air.

One method uses two silos -- one to warm and deodorize the granulate and
another to cool the granulate with cold air. In this process,
comparatively little energy is needed to warm the product to the desired
devolatilization temperature. Moreover, the cooler's process heat can be
used to pre-warm the pellets, increasing energy efficiency.

Alternatively, warming, degassing and cooling can take place in one silo
by using two Bulk-X-Change heat exchangers. This solution is much more
compact, requiring only one silo.

#### Product Range

- **ZSK Recycling Extruders and Side Degassing Unit ZS-EG:** Coperion's
  ZSK Recycling Extruders are suitable for intensive devolatilization of
  the melt. Volatile substances in small or large quantities can be
  reliably removed. In some cases the devolatilization performance
  capability with conventional top vent extruder barrels can be limited.
  In this case the ZS-EG twin screw side devolatilization unit provides
  the solution.

# PET-Recycling

#### Tags

#Pavilion #Hall9 #PlasticsRecycling

#### Description

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a high-value material that is on
course to take over a key function in the plastics industry's path
toward a circular economy. PET plays an ever more important role in
recycling, due to the large volume of packaging materials in use today.
PET posses extremely good properties for reprocessing. Its continuously
expanding use in single- and reusable bottles, as well as its recovery
via deposit systems, add to its value. Correspondingly, it can be
lucrative for companies to focus on PET recycling.

Before PET can be reprocessed, it must first be shredded to flakes and
then cleaned. Ordinary technologies require pre-drying and
crystallization of the PET flakes following washing. However, using the
specialized technology from Coperion, the shredded PET can be fed
directly into the ZSK twin screw extruder and compounded.

Thanks to the highly efficient plastification within the ZSK extruder,
Coperion systems for PET recycling achieve throughput rates up to 8 tons
per hour, therefore recycling companies profit from very high product
quality, operating and energy cost savings, and reduced logistic expense
in comparison to conventional PET recycling methods.

#### Process

The shredded flakes are reliably fed into the ZSK extruder using highly
accurate SWB (Smart Weigh Belt) feeders or gravimetric feeders from
Coperion K-Tron. In addition, other regrind materials, new materials, or
mixtures can be added. Melting, intensive devolatilization, and complete
homogenization take place in the ZSK process section before the melt is
transferred to the next process step for production of films, fibers, or
bottles.

With direct processing of PET, recyclers profit particularly from the
very high end product quality. Product handling is very gentle. The
residence time in the ZSK extruder is very short and dispersion is very
good. The ZSK extruders' high torque enables processing at low
temperatures and with almost no viscosity loss. ZSK extruders'
self-cleaning enables rapid recipe and color changes. Thanks to the ZSK
twin screw extruder's very good devolatilization options, volatile
components such as monomers, oligomers, and water are reliably removed
and channeled away from the exhaust flow in suitable separators before
discharging the process section.

Alongside the high product quality, direct processing of PET flakes
offers further advantages including reduced operating costs and energy
consumption as well as lower logistic expense.

#### Advantages

- Highest thoughput rates
- Energy and time savings as pre-drying and crystallization are omitted
- Very high quality of the end product because only a minimum iV
  degradation occurs during processing and the crystal clear material
  does not become yellowish
- High flexibility because recipes and colors can be changed very
  quickly due to the good self-cleaning behavior of the ZSK twin screw
  extruder
- Much simpler logistics because pelletized new product and different
  regenerates (ground product, agglomerates, flakes) can be processed
  together even if they have different iV value

#### Product Range

- **Twin Screw Extruders:** Coperion's ZSK twin scew extruders are
  particularly suitable for the PET recycling processes due to the
  excellent homogenization and devolatilization properties. The ZSK twin
  screw extruder can process the PET while being essentially non-dried,
  and devolatilize the melt with a low energy expenditure.

  **ZSK Mc¹⁸ Twin Screw Extruders**

- **ZS-B MEGAfeed Side Feeder:** When recycling PET, the feeding rate is
  no longer a limiting factor. With the ZS-B MEGAfeed PET flakes and
  fibers can be fed into the ZSK twin screw extruder in large
  quantities, and processed there. Existing Coperion PET recycling lines
  can be retrofitted with the ZS-B MEGAfeed technology.

- **Feeding Equipment:** Coperion K-Tron offers a variety of feeding
  solutions for plastics processing. Each technology has its own
  advantages -- what is decisive is the process know-how that brings
  operational requirements and processes together. Smart Weigh Belt
  Feeders can reliably feed large volumes of bulk material and materials
  with varying flow properties, since they weigh the bulk material prior
  to discharge and actively adapt belt speed. Vibratory Feeders are an
  ideal solution where smaller recyclates or flakes are being fed, or if
  glass fiber is added into compounding processes. Twin Screw Feeders
  are ideal for the precise feeding of finer bulk materials, and are
  therefore often used for additives.

  **Smart Weigh Belt Feeders** **Vibratory Feeders** **Twin Screw
  Feeders**

- **Material Handling:** Coperion and Coperion K-Tron offer an extensive
  line of pneumatic conveying systems and components for the transfer of
  a wide range of bulk materials, such as additive powders, resin
  pellets, recyclates, stabilizers and colors. Our experienced global
  team can support you in designing, replacing, or modernizing the
  material handling system for your process line, taking the guesswork
  out of the process.

  **Rotary Valves** **Vacuum Receivers** **Hoppers & Bin**

- **Service:** We provide standardized and highly customized service
  packages for our machines and equipment. Our comprehensive range of
  services secures maximum plant reliability and lifetime.

Geschichte von Coperion • Gründung und frühe Jahre: Coperion wurde im
Jahr 1879 gegründet und hat seinen Hauptsitz in Stuttgart, Deutschland.
• Entwicklung unter Georg Fischer: Im Jahr 2000 wurde Coperion als
Tochterunternehmen des Schweizer Unternehmens Georg Fischer gegründet.
Georg Fischer brachte dabei seine Unternehmensgruppen Waeschle und Buss
sowie die von Thyssenkrupp neu erworbene Werner & Pfleiderer in die
Coperion ein. Dies führte zu einem Anbieter von Systemen und Komponenten
für die Kunststoffverarbeitung mit 2.000 Mitarbeitenden und einem Umsatz
von rund 400 Millionen Euro. • Verkäufe und Übernahmen: Zwischen 2006
und 2007 veräußerte Georg Fischer schrittweise seine Anteile an Coperion
an die britische Beteiligungsgesellschaft Lyceum Capital. Im Jahr 2008
erwarb Coperion die Hartmann Fördertechnik GmbH in Offenbach am Main. Im
Oktober 2012 übernahm der US-Industriekonzern Hillenbrand das
Unternehmen. • Fusion mit K-Tron: Im Jahr 2010 erwarb Hillenbrand die
Firma K-Tron, einen Spezialisten für Dosieranlagen und pneumatische
Fördersysteme. Drei Jahre später, im Jahr 2013, fusionierte K-Tron mit
Coperion, wodurch der Geschäftsbereich Coperion K-Tron entstand. •
Aktueller Stand: Heute ist Coperion ein Weltmarktführer in der
Projektierung, Herstellung und Installation von Anwendungen für
Compounding und Extrusion, Schüttgutlogistik sowie zahlreicher damit
zusammenhängender Service-Dienstleistungen. Das Unternehmen ist an 30
Standorten weltweit aktiv und beschäftigt etwa 5.000 Mitarbeiter.

ist Vorsitzender der Geschäftsführung von Coperion. • Klaus Beulker,
Thomas Hummel, Falk Kohler, Markus Parzer: Diese Führungskräfte
unterstützen Ulrich Bartel in der Geschäftsführung von Coperion. •
Markus Parzer: Markus Parzer kam 1992 zu Coperion. Nach seiner
Ausbildung als Industriemechaniker arbeitete er zunächst als
Facharbeiter in der Extruder-Montage in Stuttgart, bevor er ein Studium
des Wirtschaftsingenieurwesens an der Hochschule Esslingen absolvierte.
Er hatte verschiedene Positionen in der Produktion am Standort Stuttgart

**Circular Economy** A circular economy is an economic system aimed at
eliminating waste and the continual use of resources.

**Resource Material** Plastic is viewed as a resource material, since
significant energy is used in its manufacture (base material petroleum
or natural gas) and it can be recycled well. Refuse is presorted,
crushed, and then processed into high-value regenerate which is then
reused in the plastics industry, closing the loop.

**Post-Consumer Waste** Post-consumer waste is waste originating from
users, i.e., individual persons, households, and offices.

**Post-Industrial Waste** Post-industrial waste is waste material
resulting from manufacturing or production.

**Chemical Recycling** Using chemical recycling, fossil-based resources
can be replaced by material recycled from plastic waste. Using
thermochemical processes, plastic waste is transformed and recycled into
raw materials, whereby new products with outstanding product
characteristics result, based upon recycled plastic waste.

**Mechanical Recycling** The term mechanical recycling designates the
mechanical processing of used plastics. The chemical structure remains
unchanged.

**Thermal Utilization** Incineration of plastics; should take place
whenever possible in waste incineration plants equipped for this purpose
in order to filter out highly toxic substances that are released during
incineration, such as dioxins, furans, mercury, cadmium, lead, etc.

**Upcycling** Processing of lower-value recyclates, transforming them to
higher-value compounds.

**Odor reduction** When recycling plastics, there is often the
difficulty that the plastic reused and the recyclates made from it have
strong odors. For example, post-consumer plastic waste contains migrated
substances from food, cosmetics or cleaning agents. At the same time,
residues of monomers, oxidation, hydrolysis and decomposition products
can be responsible for the unwanted odors. Odor reduction measures can
be taken in various process steps of plastics production and processing.
Coperion offers both technologies for degassing during compounding
processes and for odor reduction in silos.
