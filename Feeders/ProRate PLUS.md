#### Description
Four models, zero features you don’t need: The all-new ProRate PLUS is a feeder that may seem modest, but it shines when you use it for the first time (and, of course, every time after that). It’s a feeder that is simple to integrate, to fill, to operate, to clean. It is robust and reliable. It gets the job done, no matter what. The all new ProRate PLUS is a lot of things, but most of all, it’s surprisingly powerful.

#### Advantages
- **SIMPLE** to install and operate
- **ROBUST** design
- **RELIABLE** feeding, weighing and control technology
- Economical feeding solution
- State-of-the-art digital weighing technology for reliable performance
- ProClean Rail for easy cleaning
- Both vertical and horizontal outlets included
- ProFlow flow aid for moderate flowing bulk materials
- Fast delivery

#### Areas of Application
Reliable feeding of free-flowing bulk materials in plastic processing applications. The ProRate PLUS Continuous Gravimetric Feeder Line has been designed with the specific requirements of the plastics processing industry in mind. The single screw feeders are available in three sizes are designed for free to moderate flowing bulk materials and a twin screw feeder is available for moderate to free flowing powder additives. Due to its compact design, the ProRate PLUS not only works as a single unit but also integrated into a cluster of up to six feeders which can be easily grouped around the same extruder inlet.

#### Available Models
- **ProRate PLUS-S Feeder:** The ProRate PLUS-S feeder is designed for gravimetric feeding of free flowing bulk solids that do not require agitation. It is ideal for feeding pellets in the plastics industry. The single screw feeder with extension hopper is suspended on a single-point weighing system in a compact frame. Proven Smart Force Transducer (SFT) weighing technology provides accurate and reliable performance.
- **ProRate PLUS-M Feeder:** The ProRate PLUS-M feeder is designed for gravimetric feeding of free flowing bulk solids that do not require agitation. It is ideal for feeding pellets in the plastics industry. The single screw feeder with extension hopper is suspended on a single-point weighing system in a compact frame. Proven Smart Force Transducer (SFT) weighing technology provides accurate and reliable performance.
- **ProRate PLUS-L Feeder:** The ProRate PLUS-L feeder is designed for gravimetric feeding of free flowing bulk solids that do not require agitation. It is ideal for feeding pellets in the plastics industry. The single screw feeder with extension hopper is suspended on a two-point weighing system in a compact frame. Proven Smart Force Transducer (SFT) weighing technology provides accurate and reliable performance.
- **ProRate PLUS-MT Feeder:** The ProRate PLUS-MT twin screw feeder is designed for gravimetric feeding of moderate to free flowing bulk solids. It is ideal for feeding powder additives in the plastics industry. The twin screw feeder with extension hopper is suspended on a single-point weighing system in a compact frame. Proven Smart Force Transducer (SFT) weighing technology provides accurate and reliable performance.

#### ProRate PLUS Technology
- **Proclean Rails:** Easy access for cleaning and maintenance is always guaranteed thanks to the patent-pending ProClean Rail system. ProClean Rail is designed to allow the base unit to be retracted the rear and then rotated for optimal access. This facilitates maintenance and cleaning of the feeding unit without having to move the feeder.
  Thanks to patent-pending state-of-the-art magnetic coupling technology, the bellows and screws can be released from the outlet section without tools, while still being strong enough to guarantee the required holding force during operation.
  All ProRate PLUS models are outfitted with the ProClean Rail as a standard feature.
- **Proflow Bulk Solid Activator:** The ProFlow bulk solid activator is a completely new and cost-effective solution to feed powders.The ProFlow bulk solid activator consists of a compact electromagnetic vibrating device, which is mounted at the feeder trough and activates the polyurethane transition hopper as well as the feed hopper to keep bulk materials moving. The device operates at an optimized frequency and amplitude to ensure minimal energy consumption and maximum product flow. The device is self-calibrating, automatically tuning to the correct resonant frequency of the feeder, which results in extremely low energy consumption. Thanks to its smart electronic control ProFlow only uses 3.6 Watts. Tests with a wide range of bulk materials have shown that ProFlow is an ideal solution for a variety of bulk materials. For the smaller PLUS-S model the ProFlow activator is implemented in conjunction with specially developed overflight screws. The overflight acts as a screw filler even at low speed and helps to ensure that the bulk material is always in motion in the area of the screw intake, resulting in optimal screw fill.
- **ProRate PLUS Load Cells:** P-SFT Smart Force Transducer load cells, operating under compression, provide accurate, stable and reliable digital weight measurement under a broad range of operating conditions. The P-SFT exploits the dependency of a vibrating wire’s resonant frequency on its tension to measure applied loads. Through mechanical means the applied load is transmitted to the wire, causing a change in its resonant frequency from which the weight of the applied load is computed by the onboard microprocessor. A fully calibrated (linearized, spanned and temperature compensated) signal is transmitted via RS 485 serial communication to the controller.
- **ProRate PLUS PCM Control Modules:** With the ProRate PLUS control system each feeder has its own PCM control module, installed directly at the feeder. In a line setting, up to eight feeders can be controlled from one PCM-KD. Connection between feeders and operator interface is via an industrial network. All setup, diagnostics and operator interface functions are controlled via a the PCM-KD interface. With its tight integration into the feeder, the PCM can be pre-wired and pre-tested in the manufacturing plant.
